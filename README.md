### About
This repository contains examples on how to use Ext.Direct in conjunction with node.js server side
Note: extdirect.connector 1.x compatible examples are moved in _old folder

### Client
New examples expect ExtJS 5.1 or newer or Sencha Touch 2.3+ (Example is built using 2.4.1).
If you are looking to run Sencha Architect project you will need version 3.2 or above.

### Server
node.js server of version 0.12.2+ and Express 4.x

extdirect.connector v2.0.0+

Important: Curently v2 is in experimental state and thus not pushed to npmjs repo. You can get it from github here:
https://github.com/jurisv/nodejs.extdirect

I will also add some more tweaks to examples regarding callback format as well as around database connection.
There is no exact timeframe, but should land around ExtJS 6 release or earlier.

### Known issues
Missing metadata example in ExtJS 5
